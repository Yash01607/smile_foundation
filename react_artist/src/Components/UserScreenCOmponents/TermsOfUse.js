          Smile Foundations provides a number of Internet-based services through
          the Platform. One such Service enables Users to purchase original
          merchandise such as clothing, footwear and accessories from various
          fashion and lifestyle brands (collectively, "Products"). The Products
          can be purchased through the Platform through various methods of
          payments offered. The sale/purchase of Products shall be additionally
          governed by specific policies of sale, like cancellation policy,
          exchange policy, return policy, etc. (which are found on the FAQ tab
          on the Platform and all of which are incorporated here by reference).
          It is clarified that at the time of creating a return request, users
          are required to confirm (via a check box click) that the product being
          returned is unused and has the original tags intact. If the product
          returned by the user is used, damaged or if the original tags are
          missing, the user's return request shall be declined, and the said
          product shall be re-shipped back to the customer. In the event that
          the return request is declined, the user shall not be eligible for a
          refund, and Myntra assumes no liability in this regard. Further, in
          the event that the user fails to accept the receipt of the said
          re-shipped product, the user shall continue to be not eligible for a
          refund, and Myntra assumes no liability with respect to the return or
          refund for the said re-shipped product. In addition, these Terms of
          Use may be further supplemented by Product specific conditions, which
          may be displayed with that Product.
          <br></br>
          Myntra does not warrant that Product description or other content on
          the Platform is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free
          and assumes no liability in this regard.
